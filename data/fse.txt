               3.8 Faculty Advisor
               FSG recommends that all participating teams have a Faculty Advisor present with them at the
               competition. In the event that no Faculty Advisor is present during the competition, the Team
               Captain will take over all responsibilities of the Faculty Advisor.

               3.9 Event Handbook
               The event handbook may contain special event procedures and restrictions for example
               regarding working on the car etc. It has to be read and understood by all event participants.

               3.10 Testing and Work Safety
               All teams are advised to always follow common practices and common sense when working
               on the vehicle and when operating the vehicle, also before and after the event. Participating
               in events not suitable for Formula Student vehicles like hillclimbs, drag races or similar wheel-
               to-wheel events is prohibited.
               Whenever the car's tractive system is active, the driver must wear protection gear according
               to the rules. Additionally the following systems must be rules compliant: Shutdown Circuit,
               TSAL, IMD, BMS/AMS, Torque Encoder plausibility check, torque/brake encoder plausibility
               check and brake system plausibility device.
               Breaching this rule will lead to the team being moved to the end of the Scrutineering order no
               matter which place they originally reached in the Scrutineering quiz, see 2.13.
               The decision to move a team to the end of the Scrutineering order has to be made
               unanimously by the FSG rules committee and will be made public on the FSG website.
               NOTE: This rule has not been established to annoy you, but to ensure that we experience a
               safe and accident free Formula Student season.

               The AMS must be able to read and display all cell voltages e.g. by connecting a laptop to the
               AMS. This must be demonstrated during E-Scrutineering.

               7.4 Reset of AMS/IMD failures via Master Switches (Specific FSE change of
                   Formula SAE® 2014 Rule EV5.1.4)
               It is allowed to use the GLVS Master Switch to reset pending AMS or IMD failures.

               7.5 Tractive System Firewalls (Specific FSE change of Formula SAE® 2014 Rule
                   EV4.3)
               The tractive system firewall must comply with the main firewall regulations as defined in
               FSAE Rule T4.5. In addition a firewall must separate the driver compartment from all tractive
               system components. Note: this includes any HV wiring.
               The tractive system firewall must be composed of two layers:
               One layer, facing the tractive system side, must be made of aluminium with a minimum
               thickness of 0.7mm. This part of the tractive system firewall must be grounded according to
               FSAE Rule EV4.4.
               The second layer, facing the driver, must be made of an electrically insulating material. The
               material used for the second layer must meet UL94-V0, FAR25 or equivalent. The second
               layer must not be made of CFRP.
               The thickness of the second layer must be sufficient to prevent penetrating this layer with a
               4mm wide screwdriver and 250N of force.
               The firewall must be rigidly mounted.
               Conductive parts (except for the chassis) may not protrude through the firewall or must be
               properly insulated, see requirements above, on the driver side.

               7.6 Systems deactivating the Shutdown Circuit sharing a signal path -
                   Prohibited (Specific FSE addition to Formula SAE® 2014 Rule EV5.1)
               The IMD, BMS, Shutdown Buttons, Brake-System-Plausibility-Device, Brake-Over-
               Travel-Switch and Inertia Switch must not share a signal path in order to deactivate
               the Shutdown circuit. Therefore they must not run through the same IC or act on the
               same transistor/relay for example.

               8   Technical Inspection


               8.1 Inspection & Testing Requirement

               The Technical Inspection will be divided in an electrical inspection and a mechanical
               inspection.
               The electrical inspection will declare the car as electrically safe and must be the first
               inspection. Before passing  E-Scrutineering the car may only be moved around on the event
               site, if both detachable keys of the Master Switches have been removed and are kept safe by
               an Electrical System Officer.


               Scrutineers will mark or seal various different approved parts (i.e. insulation monitoring
               device, accumulator containers, energy meter, tires, rims etc.). The car can be disqualified
               from any dynamic event by using unmarked parts or substituting marked parts. Parts with
               broken seals are equivalent to being unmarked.
               Broken seals can only be replaced by a scrutineer.

               After passing E-Scrutineering the car can be presented for the normal mechanical
               scrutineering.

               The Scrutineering Inspection sheet will be made available on the FSG website at
               http://www.formulastudent.de/fse/2014/rules/
               8.2 Equipment

               For the electric part of the technical inspection each team must present the following
               equipment:

                     accumulator charger to be used during the event
                     all accumulator containers to be used during the event
                     data sheets for all used parts in the tractive system
                     Copy of the ESF
                     Copy of the FMEA
                     Accumulator Container Hand Cart, if needed
                     Tools as listed in Formula SAE® 2014 Rule EV8.4

               8.3 Car weighing
               All cars will be weighed prior to Engineering Design Judging. All cars are to be weighed in
               ready to race condition. All fluids and coolant must be in the car. This weight will be the car’s
               Official Technical Inspection weight.  There will be a penalty if the car weight changes during
               Dynamic Competition.  The allowable weight tolerance is ± 5.0 kg.  In the case of overweight
               or underweight in comparison to the Technical Inspection weight, the team will be penalized
               -20 (twenty) points for each kg (or portion of a kg) of additional or missing weight. This point
               penalty will be deducted from the Engineering Design Event score. (Each 0.1 to 1.0 kg = -20
               points)
               Example:
               If the car is 5.3 kg underweight: 5.3 kg minus the 5.0 kg tolerance = 0.3 kg equals -20 Points
               If the car is 7.8 kg overweight: 7.8 kg minus the 5.0 kg tolerance = 2.8 kg equals -60 Points
               If the car weight changes due to replacement of broken parts, the car must be presented for
               tech inspection and then re-weighed. It is the team's responsibility to have the car re-weighed
               before entering a dynamic event after changing parts.

               8.4 Inspection Holes
               To allow the verification of tubing wall thickness, 4.5 mm (0.18 inch) inspection holes must be
               drilled in a non-critical location of both the Main Hoop and the Front Hoop. In addition, the
               Technical Inspectors may check the compliance of other tubes that have minimum
               dimensions specified. This may be done by the use of ultra sonic testing or by the drilling of
               additional inspection holes at the inspector’s request. Inspection holes must be located so
               that the outside diameter can be measured ACROSS the inspection hole with a vernier
               caliper, i.e. there must be access for the vernier caliper to the inspection hole and to the
               outside of the tube one hundred eighty degrees (180°) from the inspection hole.

               Plan to the Executive Board of a major auto manufacturing company

               9.1.2 Deep dive topic

               After submission of the Executive Summary the teams will receive a specific Deep Dive Topic
               from the presentation judges prior the competition. The task will be sent via email on the date
               specified in the Action Deadlines, to the team’s responsible person’s email address.
               Every team has to present this special Deep Dive Topic as a part of the team’s business plan
               presentation to the judges.
               NOTE: A team should not describe only this Deep Dive Topic in the business plan
               presentation. It’s important that a team presents a good business plan as well.


               9.1.3 Data Projection Equipment
               Video Projectors will be provided by Formula Student Electric. These Projectors will have

               T min/Lap  will be the lowest corrected Endurance time  per completed lap  of the fastest team of
               the event.
               T yours/Lap  will be the corrected Endurance time  per completed lap  of the team being scored.
               Vehicles whose corrected time exceeds 1.333 times the corrected time of the fastest team,
               will receive zero (0) points for Efficiency.

               E min/Lap  is the lowest consumed Endurance energy  per completed lap  by any competitor.
               E yours/Lap  is the consumed Endurance energy  per completed lap  of the team being scored.

               The consumed Endurance energy is calculated as the time integrated value of the measured
               voltage multiplied by the measured current logged by the energy meter. Regenerated energy
               will be multiplied with 0.9 and subtracted from the used energy, as long as the fed back
               currents remain within the maximum values given in the cell data sheet.

               EfficiencyFactor min  is fixed at 0.1, which represents the EfficiencyFactor resulting from a
               maximum Endurance time of 1.333*Tmin and an EnergyUsage of 20.33kWh (equivalent to 5.72L petrol), assuming that the minimum usage is 2.75kWh.


               EfficiencyFactor max  is the maximum EfficiencyFactor reached by any team.

               Before the endurance event, every energy meter memory storage may be cleared by an
               official. The energy meter data is read out when the car is in Parce Fermé.

               11.1 Vehicle Configuration

               No part of the vehicle may be higher than the highest point of the Main Hoop in any car setup.
               The reference plane to evaluate this rule will be parallel to the ground and on top of the main
               roll hoop.


















               11.2 Aerodynamic Devices
               Any specific part of the car significantly influencing its aerodynamic performance must be
               rigidly secured to the entirely sprung part of the car (rigidly secured means not having any
               degree of freedom).
