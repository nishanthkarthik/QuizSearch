2.4  ORGANISATIONAL ASPECTS 

2.4.1  REGISTRATION 

Tuesday, 29 July
14:00      Scrutineering, registration & entrance order available (Ticket Centre)  
16:00 – 18:00  Team registration (Ticket Centre)  
18:00 – Sun 20:00  Pits available  
18:00 – 20:00  Driver & saftey responsible registration (Event Control)  
18:00 – 22:00  Entrance for team vehicles  
All team captains received a registration document with standard terms and 
personal information of all registered members. This document must be prin- 
ted out, signed by ALL team members and brought to registration. Only the 
team captain is to sign this paper at registration and confirm with his/her sig - 
nature the correctness and validity of all other signatures. With his signature, 
the team captain also guarantees that only team members worked on the car 
and that the saftey guidelines were followed. 

Truck Parking: 
The truck driver of each team is to wait at the truck stop for his/her team 
captain to hand over the green vehicle entrance pass with the entrance num- 
ber. Coffee will be available for free during the waiting period.
•  Do not block emergency exits! 
•  Follow the instructions of the marshals! 
•  Do not move your truck to the FSG gateway entrance until order from the 
marshals is received to do so. 

Ticket Centre: 
ONLY event team captains may register their team. They can be accompanied 
by only ONE other team member! The ticket centre consists of 3 containers: 
one for "guests & press" and two for "teams & visitors". Please check the re- 
gistration/scrutineering order before getting in line. One of the "teams & visi- 
tors" containers deals with the odd and the other one with the even numbers 
of the registration/scrutineering order. Please try to get the right order in the 
queues. The event team captain has to sign the document with all signatures 
and will then receive all passes for his registered team members, an event 
guideline poster and a green vehicle entrance pass. The team is then ready to 
enter FSG in the given order. 

Event Control: 
At the event control, the event team captain will receive a package containing 
shirts, programmes, etc. Large teams may bring 1 or 2 extra people to help 
carrying. 

Driver Registration: 
Each team has to register at least 4 drivers. The drivers register themselves at the event control where they 
have to show their valid driver's license as well as a student ID. They will then receive wristbands marking them 
as drivers. 

2.4.2  PARKING / VEHICLE ENTRANCE PASS 

You are allowed to enter the venue with a vehicle ONLY if you have a vehicle entrance pass. At the registrati- 
on, you receive a green vehicle entrance pass for 1 vehicle you want to park permanently during the event. On 
request, you can receive additional yellow vehicle entrance passes that allow you to enter for 1 hour for rea- 
sons of unloading or loading. No yellow passes will be given out after Sunday , 16:00. You will have to fill out the  
vehicle entrance pass with the license-plate number, the team name, the driver's name and the mobile phone 
number of the driver and display it behind the windscreen. When you enter the gateway, please line up in the 
queue on the right site at the barrier and wait until there is enough room for more vehicles to come in. Since 
all teams should get the chance to enter the site fast, please try and unload quickly and follow the instructions  




of the officials. Don’t stay on site with a yellow permit longer 
than necessary!
The parking area can be found at the “Querspange”, on the 
other side of the fence behind the dynamic area. There is one 
parking lot with approximately 25 m² per team. When entering 
the Hockenheim ring with the green vehicle entrance pass, 
you have 30 minutes to unload your truck in front of your pit. 
Afterwards, the truck has to be parked on the “Querspange”. 
Please note, that it is not possible to drive to the pits again. 
This means, that during and after the event, your team will have 
to transport all its equipment between the pits and your truck 
by foot. At the "Querspange" the trucks will be accessible at 
all times. If you come with a container or a trailer which needs 
more than 30 m² you have to deposit this in a parking area outside the venue. The parking area has to be left 
by the Monday, after the event, until 10:00.
Walking speed is the speed limit on the entire event site. Pavilions are not allowed on the entire event site.

your bodywork.
The tags will be positioned on the left side of your vehicle: one tag in the area of the car’ s nose and one tag in  
the area of the sidepod / side impact structure. 
These tags must not be removed until the competition ends, since they are vital for the timekeeping system.

•  Cars with wings are required to have two team members walking on either side of the vehicle whenever 
the vehicle is being pushed. 

2.5.17 HOW TO WHEEL THE CAR (FSE) 

Whenever a car is moved, there must be:
•  A driver wearing a full safety suit seated in the cockpit. 
•  A fire extinguisher accompanying the car at all times. 
•  Someone pushing the car with a pushbar. 
•  Cars with wings are required to have two team members walking on either side of the vehicle whenever 
the vehicle is being pushed. 
•  The detachable handle or key of the tractive system master switch must be taken-off completely and kept 
by a safety responsible (SR). 
•  In case that the car has not passed E-Scrutineering, the HVD must be disconnected, while the car is mo- 
ved around on the event site. This also includes taking part in static events. 

2.5.18 SPECIAL NOTE FOR DRIVERS 

All drivers should do a check of critical fasteners and components on their vehicles to assure complete control 
during the driving events. Fasteners come loose, parts break due to fatigue, and occasionally someone forgets 
to torque a nut – this may have serious consequences for your safety! 
REMEMBER: USE THE KILL SWITCH in case of an engine or brake malfunction!  
HAVE FUN – DRIVE SAFELY – USE COMMON SENSE!

3.1  GENERAL INFORMATION 

The dynamics at FSG are compliant with the FSAE rules Part D and additional FSG Rules. The following pages 
describe the additional procedures and key aspects. Other information will be provided at the morning briefin gs  
on site.  

3.1.1  TEAM / DRIVER-BRIEFINGS 

There are team briefings every morning of the competition at the Marquee (On Thursday at 8:00, on Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday at 07:30). All team captains and drivers for that day must attend. The briefing contain s  
general event information and detailed information about the dynamic events of the day. 
The RFID-wristband will be scanned at the entrance of the Marquee to log the driver as attendant on the pre- 
sent day. Without this scan, participation at the dynamic events of the day is not possible. Missing the briefing 
means missing the dynamic events. 

3.1.2  ACCESS TO THE DYNAMIC AREA 

Every team will receive four vests. With these vests, four team members including the driver and/or the Sa- 
fety Responsible (FSE only) may enter the dynamic area. Please note that the vests are not fireproof. Drivers   
may take them off for driving, but must put them back on afterwards. 

3.1.3  WEATHER 

This is one of the factors which can not be influenced by the event organisation. So please be aware that the 
the timetable will not be changed due to bad weather conditions. 
Under normal conditions, the track is declared dry. If it is necessary to declare damp or wet conditions, there 
will be signs and announcements at the dynamic area. Please read the rules for more information.
An exception is this years skid pad event. The track will be sprayed with water and hence declared wet all day. 

3.1.4  CAR SET-UP ALTERATIONS (FSAE RULE T1.2.2) 

Teams do not have to use the same car set-up for all the dynamic events and are encouraged to make ad- 
justments (e.g. tyre pressure and suspension settings) to give the vehicle characteristics best suited to each 
specific event. However, the car must comply with the rules (e.g. ground clearance etc.).
Teams that remove their car from the event site automatically lose all their stickers from technical inspection 
(E-Scrutineering, Scutineering, Tilt Table, Rain, Brake and Noise)

Location:  Charging Area 
The charging of tractive system accumulators is exclusively allowed in the charging area.
No more than four team members of an individual FSE team are allowed to be in the charging area at the 
same time. Only charging devices marked during E-Scrutineering may be used. If the accumulators are to be 
charged inside the car, the team has to make sure that the car cannot enter a ready-to-drive state during 
charging under any circumstances. Furthermore, all driven wheels have to be off the ground by jacking the 
vehicle up. A team member has to always stay with the car / accumulators during charging. The accumulator 
containers or the car itself, depending on whether the accumulators are charged externally or internally, must 
have a label with the following data:
•  Team name 
•  Safety responsible (SR) 
•  Approximate time at which the charging period ends (date and time). 
The team member supervising the car while charging should have necessary knowledge to act accordingly if 
any problems occur. 

3.1.8  ACCUMULATOR WORKPLACES (FSE) 

Schedule:  Tue  29 July   from 18:00 
    Wed  30 July   round the clock

    Fri  1 August  round the clock  
    Sat  2 August  round the clock  
    Sun  3 August   until 15:00  
Location:  Charging Area  
Activities on accumulators are permitted exclusively at the accumulator workplaces. Only FSE team members 
and FSG officials have access to it. A security guard is present at all times. Please also refer to the guideline s  
in chapter 2.5.3. No more than four team members of an individual FSE team are allowed to be in the char- 
ging area at the same time. Work on the accumulators must always be supervised by a safety responsible. 



3.2  TECHNICAL & SAFETY INSPECTION 

Cars have to pass a technical and safety inspection before being allowed to practice or take part in the dyna-
mic disciplines. The car/team gets the first inspection sticker when E-scrutineering is passed and the secon d  
sticker if mechanical scrutineering is passed. The third sticker will be given at the tilt table test, the fourth at 
the rain test, and the fifth at the brake test (incl. Ready-To-Drive-Sound-Test). Then, and only then, a car/team 
is allowed to compete in the dynamic events and to practise at the test tracks. 

3.2.1  E-SCRUTINEERING (FSE ONLY) 

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
    Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Sat  2 August  on request  
  
Location:  Pit Lane 
The car may only be moved around on the event site with all master switches 
and shutdown buttons in off-position and the HVD open. Therefore, the CS-mas- 
ter switch, the TS-master switch, the right, the left and the cockpit shutdown 
button have to be turned off! Furthermore, the detachable handle or key of the 
tractive system master switch has to be removed and kept safe by a safety 
responsible.
No FSE vehicle is allowed at mechanical scrutineering before it has passed E-scrutineering.
Scrutineers will mark or seal various different approved parts (i.e. insulation monitoring device, accumulator 
containers, energy meter, tires, rims etc.). The car can be disqualified from any dynamic event by using un - 
marked parts or substituting marked parts. Parts with broken seals are equivalent to being unmarked.
Broken seals can only be replaced by a scrutineer.
To Scrutineering you must bring:
•  The Technical Inspection sheet - it must always stay with the car (during E- and mechanical scrutinee-
ring). 
•  Accumulator charger to be used during the event 
•  All accumulator containers to be used during the event 
•  Data sheets for all used parts in the tractive system 
•  Copy of the ESF 
•  Copy of the FMEA 
•  Accumulator Container Hand Cart, if needed 
•  Tools and protection equipment as defined in the FSE rules 
•  Print-out of rule questions (if needed) 
•  NOTE: Four team members maximum in the inspection box 
Insulation Monitoring Device Test (IMDT):
The insulation monitoring device will be tested during E-scrutineering. This is done by connecting a resistor 
between several parts of the tractive system and electrically conductive vehicle parts while the tractive system 
is active. The size of the resistor is defined as 250 Ohm/V related to the maximum tractive system operation 
voltage. The test is passed if the insulation monitoring device shuts down the tractive system whenever the 
resistor connects the tractive system to grounded parts.
The IMDT may be repeated at any time during the event. After the car passes the test for the first time, cri - 
tical parts of the tractive system will be sealed. The vehicle is not allowed to take part in any dynamic event if 
any of the seals are broken until the IMDT is successfully passed again. 



3.2.2  MECHANICAL SCRUTINEERING 

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
    Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Sat  2 August  on request  
  
Location:  Dynamic Area – surrounding tents at DEKRA House 
Before taking part in any of the dynamic events, you must take your car to 
scrutineering. You can do this at any time during the specified hours and do not 
need to make an appointment. The order for the scrutineering is obtained by 
ranking the teams on the basis of the time they needed to complete the scruti- 
neering quiz correctly.
To get all the teams through scrutineering as fast as possible, there will be up to eight teams of scrutineers. 
The scrutineering takes place at the Dekra house, which is within the dynamics area. All team members who 
want to participate in scrutineering need a dynamics gate ID. The waiting queue for scrutineering will start 
directly at the dynamic’s gate so every team member can guide the car up to the queue.
Please note:
•  Driver's equipment will be checked at the dynamic gate before entering for scrutineering. 
•  No FSE vehicle is allowed at scrutineering before it has passed E-scrutineering. 
•  The Technical Inspection sheet must always stay with the car (during E- and mechanical scrutineering). 
To scrutineering you must bring:
•  The car (in finished condition obviously) 
•  Copies of any Safety Structure Equivalency Forms 
•  Copies of any Impact Attenuator Data Requirement 
•  A test piece from the imact attenuator 
•  Teams with MONOCOQUE: Must see laminate test specimen 
•  All helmets you plan to use at the event 
•  All driver suits and other safety gear 
•  The tallest driver of the team 
•  All the tyres you plan to use at the event 
•  2 fire extinguishers 
•  Quick jack + push bar 
•  Some tools 
•  NOTE: Four team members maximum (incl. the tallest registered driver) in the inspection box. 
Please be well prepared as there is only 1 hour of scrutineering time per team:
•  If you do not finish Scrutieering within the given timeframe you have to leave the dynamic area, fix all comp - 
laints and rejoin the queue at the end. 
•  Enter Scrutineering with the tallest driver in the car, belted, and prepared for roll bar height and egress 
check. 
•  Your other drivers might be checked as well upon request of the scrutineer. 
•  If the scrutineers feel that the car is NOT in „finished condition“ (per Rule S2.6) the inspection process will 
be stopped and the team has to leave the dynamic area. 
The technical form will be retained by the scrutineers and you should proceed to the tilt table. If you have items 
that need to be rectified, the form will be returned to you (the team), you will not get your sticker , and you will  
have to present your car for scrutineering again. Scrutineering reserves the right to spot check any car at any 
time during the event. 

3.2.3  TILT TABLE TESTING  

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
  Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
Location:  Dynamic Area 
Tilt testing checks if the vehicle complies with the liquid spillage and rollover 
stability rules. No vehicle is permitted at this station until it has passed mecha- 
nical Scrutineering. The stickers that must be applied to the car will serve as 
proof of this.
At this point we want to remind the teams to bring the car in ‘ready to race’ condition. That means that all t he  
liquids of the car should be filled properly, all  components of the car are mounted.
The vehicle will be placed upon the table with the tallest driver aboard. The vehicle should be oriented on the 
tilt table in the direction that is most likely to create spillage. The table will then be tilted to an angle of 45 de- 
grees. There must be no fluid leakage at this angle. If the vehicle passes this test, the angle is increased to 6 0  
degrees. This angle is used to represent a cornering force of 1.7 Gs. If the upper wheels remain on the table 
the vehicle passes. (Some vehicles may lift one wheel. The station manager(s) should be consulted if this oc- 
curs). The person in charge at the tilt table must sign an inspection form, which travels with the car. A sticker 
is applied (on the car), to indicate it passed the tilt table test.
FSE vehicles are now free to proceed to the rain test. Should the vehicle (FSC and FSE) fail at either of the two 
angles, the car must be repaired and re-tested.
Vehicles may be asked to return to this station for re-certification at the discretion of the officials. 

Safety guidelines for the tilt area: 
•  Four team members maximum (incl. the tallest registered driver) in the tilt table area 
•  All engines and master switches off, push car on and off table. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the 
vehicle when pushed on and off the tilt table. 
•  Inside wheels are to be placed against the guard of the tilt table. 
•  Attach a strap to rollover hoop and side of table which is to be elevated. Allow a little slack. (Team mem-
bers may be asked to hold the car, if a strap is not available). 
•  Be sure table is clear before raising and especially when lowering. Inform people in area when raising or 
lowering (e.g. “Coming Down”). 
•  Use absorbent material to soak up leaks (may be obtained at fuel station). Keep a fire extinguisher at hand. 

3.2.4  RAIN TESTING (FSE ONLY) 

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
  Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
  
Location:  Dynamic Area 
Teams have to pass a special rain test during scrutineering. The car has to 
pass E-scrutineering, Scrutineering, and Tilt Table before the rain test can be 
conducted.
During the rain test, the tractive system has to be active and none of the 
driven wheels may be in contact with the ground. It is not allowed to have a 
driver seated in the car during the rain test. 

3.2.5  NOISE TESTING (FSC) 

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
  Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
Location:  Dynamic Area 
The vehicle will be checked for compliance with the sound level restrictions. No vehicle is permitted at this 
station until it has passed scrutineering and the tilt table test. Proof of this are the two stickers which must be 
applied to the car.
Teams must bring a laptop for reaching a constant engine speed more precisely and to show the engine rpm 
monitored from the ecu on the laptop. Sound level must not exceed 110dBA during running the calculated 
engine rpm.
If the vehicle passes the test, the person in charge is to sign the approval form and provide the team with the 
third sticker. The vehicle is now free to proceed to the brake test.
If the vehicle is unable to pass in three attempts, the car must be repaired and then brought back for retest. 
The vehicle will not be allowed to compete without passing this test.
The noise level can be measured at any time during the dynamic events. Penalties may be given if the sound 
level exceeds the mandated maximum. Vehicles may be forced to return to this station for re-certification 
should the officials deem it necessary. Re-certification may be required if work 
is performed on the vehicle’s exhaust system or if the vehicle is involved in an 
incident which results in vehicle damage.  

3.2.6  READY-TO-DRIVE-SOUND-TEST (FSE) 

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
  Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
Location:  Dynamic Area 
The Ready-To-Drive-Sound-Test checks the Ready-To-Drive-Sound for fulfillment of the rules. No vehicle is per - 
mitted at this station until it has passed E-Scrutineering, mechanical Scrutineering, tilt table and the rain test. 
Proof are the respective “tech” stickers, which must be applied to the car.
The car will be positioned in the testing area with a driver sitting in it with none of the driven wheels touching 
the ground. The driver will then activate the tractive system and set the car to Ready-T o-Drive-Mode being defi- 
ned as the motors responding to input of the torque encoder.
The car has to make a characteristic sound, once not continuous, when it is ready to drive. The sound level 
has to be a minimum of 70dBA, fast weighing, for at least 1 second and a maximum of 3 seconds in a radius 
of 2m around the car. The used sound has to be easily recognizable. No animal voices, song parts or sounds 
that can be interpreted as offensive will be accepted.
The test may be repeated to conduct several measurements around the car. 




3.2.7  BRAKE TESTING (FSC) 

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
  Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
Location:  Dynamic area, behind the DEKRA house  
Brake Testing checks that the vehicle can be brought to a controlled stop. No vehicle is permitted at this 
station until it has passed tech inspection, the tilt table test, and the noise test. Proofs of this are the three 
stickers which must be applied to the car.
Each driver must be instructed as to the proper procedure for the brake test. With the car at the start line 
of the station a green flag (or similar signal) should be used to signal the star t of each run. The driver must  
accelerate (typically getting into 2nd gear) until reaching the braking area, which is a box defined by pylons. 
Once inside this box, the driver must apply the brakes with enough force to demonstrate full lock-up of all four 
wheels. A second marshal should wave a red flag as the driver enters the box.
If the vehicle passes the test, the person in charge is to sign the approval form and provide the team with the 
last tech sticker. The vehicle is now free to proceed to the practice track or on to the dynamic events.
If the vehicle is unable to pass either of the two tests in three attempts, the car must be repaired and then 
brought back for retesting. The vehicle will not be allowed to compete without passing this test.
Re-certification may be required if work is performed on the vehicle’s brake 
system or if the vehicle is involved in an incident which results in vehicle dama- 
ge. 

3.2.8  BRAKE TESTING (FSE) 

Schedule:  Wed  30 July   09:00 – 13:00, 14:00 – 19:00  
  Thu  31 July   08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 12:00, 13:00 – 19:00  
Location:  Dynamic area, behind the DEKRA house  
Brake Testing checks that the vehicle can be brought to a controlled stop. No vehicle is permitted at this 
station until it has passed E-scrutineering, mechanical scrutineering, tilt table testing, rain testing and ready-to-
drive-sound-testing. Proofs of this are the respective stickers which must be applied to the car.
Each driver must be instructed as to the proper procedure for the brake test. With the car at the start line of 
the station a green flag (or similar signal) should be used to signal the star t of each run. The driver must acce- 
lerate on a short straight until reaching the braking area, which is a box defined by pylons. Before entering in 
this box, the tractive system has to be switched off by the driver and the brake pedal must be actuated as far 
as possible. The brake test is successful if all four wheels lock.
Note: It may take up to 5secs until the Tractive System Active Light goes off after shutting down the tractive 
system.
If the vehicle is unable to pass the test in three attempts, the car must be repaired and then brought back for 
retesting. The vehicle will not be allowed to compete without passing this test. Re-cer tification may be required  
if work is performed on the vehicle’s brake system or if the vehicle is involved in an incident which results in 
vehicle damage. 

3.2.9  ENERGY METER INSTALLATION  

The energy meter will be installed prior to or during E-scrutineering. The energy meter responsibles will be situ-
ated at E-scrutineering and hand out the energy meter and needed connectors. They will also help with installa-
tion, if needed, and answer upcoming questions.
The proper function of the energy meter will be evaluated by the energy meter responsibles after the team has 
passed E-scrutineering. 



The energy meter responsible will read out data from time to time via a wireless connection to determine, if 
the 85kW limit was obeyed during the dynamic events. 
The energy meter data used to calculate the efficiency scoring will be read out in the parc ferme. 
After the data was read out the energy meter has to be removed from the car and returned to the energy 
meter responsible.
We encourage all teams to record own efficiency data for the unlikely event of an energy meter failure during 
the endurance event. Any attempt to manipulate the intended function of the energy meter may lead to a dis- 
qualification from the entire event. If you have any questions with respect to the energy meter , please ask for  
the energy meter responsible at event control. 

3.3  TESTING 

Schdule:  Thu  31 July   09:00 – 19:00

Location:  Thu  31 July    Big dynamic area  
    Fri  1 August   Big dynamic area  
    Sat  2 August   Small dynamic area  
    Sun  3 August   Small dynamic area  
On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the big dynamic area is available for 
testing (up to two tracks on Wednesday and Thursday, one track on Friday). 
The ground is made of asphalt. Teams may use the test areas to set up and test their cars. The testing time 
per team depends on the waiting queue and will be 3 to 5 minutes per run. For additional testing, teams have 
to get back in line.
On Saturday and Sunday, the small dynamics area is available for testing. Unfortunately, the ground of this 
area differs a lot from the one at the big dynamics area. It is made of concrete, partially painted and shows 
small bumps. Hence, it provides less grip. Please keep the ground condition in mind when setting up your car 
for the events. 
Dynamics Area on Thursday – Testing / Technical checks 



3.4  DYNAMIC DISCIPLINES 

3.4.1  SKID PAD  

Schedule:  Fri  1 August  11:00 – 18:30  
Location:  Dynamic area  
There will be a two lane queue for this event. Lane one is for the first driver 
of the team, lane two for the second driver. The queue closes 15-30 minutes 
before the end of the event, depending on the number of cars waiting.
Each driver can choose to drive one or two runs in a row. The second run may 
be performed immediately after the first run without re-entering the queue.
Skid Pad will be carried out on a very very wet track as a suspension challenge 
to judge how teams cope in such conditions.

3.4.3  ACCELERATION 

Schedule:   Sat  2 August  08:30 – 13:00  
Location:  Start/Finish Line of the Hockenheimring 
Similar to the Skid Pad event, the waiting queue for the Acceleration event is 
a two lane queue. Lane one is for the first driver of the team, lane two for the 
second driver. The queue closes 15-30 minutes before the end of the event, 
depending on the number of cars waiting.
Each driver can choose to drive one or two runs in a row. The second run may 
be performed immediately after the first run without stepping back to the end 
of the queue.
This year’s acceleration event is located at the start/finish line of the F1 circuit. Waiting cue and warm up 
area is situated on the track. After passing the finish line of the Acceleration, there is a big slow down area 
(Nordkurve) before you have to turn into the “F1 pit lane” to return to the start for the second run. In case of 
passing the spectator area while driving through the pit lane, a slow car speed is recommended and enforced 
by the officials. 



3.4.2  AUTOCROSS 

Schedule:  Sat  2 August  13:05 – 13:25   Course walk  
    Sat  2 August  13:30 – 18:30   Autocross  
Location:  Dynamic area 
Autocross is installed at the paddock of the Hockenheim GP racetrack. There- 
fore, the track is lined with cones. Green cones are used for the track bound- 
ary, orange cones are used for slalom and blue cones are used for entrance 
and exit of the course. The track direction is clockwise. Each run comprises 
one lap with a flying start. Two cars are on the track at the same time with 
an offset of half a lap. Each driver can choose to drive one or two runs in a 
row. The second run may be performed immediately after the first run without re-entering the queue. If the 
runs are performed separately, the driver must exit the course after the first run and drive through the driver 
change area slowly back to the start for the second run. The queue closes 15-30 minutes before the end of 
the event, depending on the number of cars waiting.
Due to the fact that multiple cars are on the track simultaneously , a stalled car can influence the lap time of  
the other car. In this case, the run for the stalled car is lost. For the other cars, a rerun of the lap is allowed. 



3.4.4  ENDURANCE  

Schedule:  Sun  3 August   08:00 – 08:20   Course walk  
    Sun  3 August   08:30 – 13:00   Endurance FSG  
    Sun  3 August  13:00 – 18:00  Endurance FSG  
Location:  Dynamic area 
The endurance track will be set up Sunday. Everybody can visit the track before 
the endurance starts. The colouring of the cones is similar to the Autocross 
event. The three additional overtaking lanes are marked with blue cones.
The starting order for Endurance results from the Autocross event. The slo- 
west FSC/FSE car starts at 08:30. The following car starts 3 minutes later. 
The maximum number of cars to be on the track at the same time is three. 
Due to weather conditions, the starting order may change. The valid order will 
be annonced at 21:30 on Saturday and it will be displayed at the FSG forum. During the driver change, two 
scrutineers check the car. After successful driver change, the second driver drives to the entrance gate. If a 
marshal causes the driver change to take longer than the allowed 3 minutes, the time caused by the marshal 
will be subtracted. Timekeeping is watching for these incidents.
Cars that get a blue flag please drive into the next overtaking lane. You do not have to slow down before the 
overtaking lanes. Please start slowing down when you are in the overtaking lane NOT before. For the faster 
car, it is necessary to not follow the car in front too closely. Otherwise serious damage may be caused if the 
cars touch each other. Rear-ending a slower car will definitely lead to a disqualification of the faster car!
All vehicles that successfully finish Endurance and those that make it passed the driver change must repor t to  
the Parc Fermé. They will stay there until 30 minutes after the time limit for appeal. 



4  STATIC EVENTS 

4.1  ENGINEERING DESIGN AND COST ANALYSIS EVENT - PROCEDURE  

The judging area will be located on the 2nd floor of the pits. The cars will be 
liftet with the FSG car lift (see figure). The cars needs to be at the lift 1 hour be-
fore the judging will start. Please be aware that when moving the vehicle from 
the elevator to the judging bay rule 2.5.16/17 still applies!
The engineering design event and cost analysis will be back to back. As a team 
you will have 10 minutes to setup your car and all presentation devices like 
charts, boards etc. once in the judging bay assigned to you. Your team will stay 
in this judging bay for both events. After finishing the first event, you will have a 
10 minute break, before the second static event. The judges will come to your 
judging bay. After the second event you are kindly requested to
leave the judging area. To find out your judging bay and judging times, please 
check the schedule on the website or on the event.
Team & Car Photo
After these two static events, we will take a photo of your team and car while you are waiting for the elevator 
which carries your car down to the ground level. Please ensure that any team members that did not participate 
in the static events are available for the picture. 



4.2  ENGINEERING DESIGN EVENT 

Schedule:  Thu   31 July   13:15 – 17:55   Design Event (FSE) 
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 18:10   Design Event (FSC)  
    Fri  1 August  19:00 – 20:30   Design Finals (FSE) 
    Sat  2 August  19:00 – 21:30   Design Finals (FSC)  
Location:  Marquee above pits (Design Event)  
    FSG Forum (Design Finals)  
Chief Judges:  Dietmar Becker  
  Pat Clarke 
  Rudolf Dittrich 
Formula Student Germany is an international design competition. This means, the design event is the most 
important static event. The winner of the design event will get 150 points.
Here are some tips to help you score higher in the engineering design event:  Be on time! Make sure your car 
is in race-ready condition and your team members are well prepared. Bring all engineering documentation with 
you. Read and understand the rules. 

Judging Sequence 
At Formula Student Germany, design judging will involve two parts:
1. Initial judging of all vehicles
2. Final judging ranking the top vehicles.
You should start with a 3-5 minute overview presentation of the car. It is up to you how you use this presen-
tation time: introducing the team, the car or the design goals etc. This presentation time will be followed by 
around 40 minutes discussion with the judges. You are done after 60/55 minutes (FSE/FSC).
There is no time limit in the design finals. The design finals are not public. The number of team members du - 
ring design finals depends on the number of finalists and will be published with the list of finalists.
To score high in the design event, we would suggest you to bring all necessary papers with you, which under- 
line your engineering work. If you have done any tests, bring the results with you. Judges only believe what they 
see, not what you tell them. Read the Caroll Smith “Everything You Wanted to Know about Design Judging” 
paper available on the Formula SAE website.
The judges will be around on Friday and Saturday. Feel free to ask them about your car. They will be more than 
happy to answer all your questions. 




4.3  COST ANALYSIS EVENT 

Schedule:  Thu  31 July   13:30 – 18:10   Cost Event (FSE) 
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 18:40   Cost Event (FSC) 
Location:  Marquee above pits   

The Cost Report 
The actual cost report is due approximately six to seven weeks prior to the 
event at the venue. A printed copy of the report must be presented to the jud-
ges during the cost event. The cost report is judged on the basis of the cost of 
the car and quality of the cost report. The cost of the car is determined by the 
cost of the parts and fabrication using established manufacturing practices. 
The report will follow the guidelines set forth in the published rules. From this 
analysis. the judges (in 8 distinct areas of expertise) will determine if all parts 
and processes were included. The judges will add penalties.if costs are unreasonably low (by experience of the 
judges), if errors are detected, or if items are omitted. 
The Real Case Situation 
Like any other situation in real life, nobody knows what’s coming next. Teams will be given a specific task after 
the submission of their cost reports. This task is developed by the judges and steering committee members of 
Formula Student Germany. The teams have to present their solutions in a 10 minute presentation during the 
cost event.
Addenda to the report can be taken into consideration to cover any necessary changes made to the car. These 
addenda will only be accepted at the time of registration at the event and must be in the format proscribed by 
the rules.
The final scores are tabulated and presented at the end of the judging day to the statisticians and are posted   
on the evening for the students viewing. Once posted, the scores may be protested against for one hour. After 
that, all scores become final. 

4.4  BUSINESS PLAN PRESENTATION EVENT 

Schedule:  Thu  31 July   13:30 – 18:10    Presentation (FSE)  
    Thu  31 July   18:30 – 20:00    Finals (FSE) 
    Fri  1 August  08:30 – 18:40    Presentation (FSC)  
    Fri  1 August  20:00 – 21:00    Finals (FSC)  
Location:  BW Tower, Start-Finish Building (Presentation)  
    Marquee above pits (Finals)  

The Presentation 
Competitors are to make a presentation to upper level executives of an imagi- 
nary manufacturer/investor. The presentation should tie together all factors 
that would influence the marketability and manufacturability of their design. 
The technical aspects of the vehicle design should be presented to reinforce or support performance claims 
but should be reduced to the maximum necessary for an investment decision. The competitors should show an 
understanding of the marketplace and the targeted customer. Furthermore they should show how their design 
fits into its expected market and how it is completed to a business model. Competitors must convince the 
judges that their prototype and the related concept represents a profitable enterprise for the manufacturer/
investor and taht is is simply an attractive investment. 

Judging Process  
The business plan presentation event will be held in a three step approach. In advance, every team has to sub-
mit an executive summary. The first presentation round (incl. deep dive topic) will be relevant for all teams and 
the finals will be relevant only for the top 3 - 5 tems. 

Executive Summary 
Prior to the business plan presentation event the teams have to hand in an executive summary. This summary 
must not exceed one page. The executive summary should contain a brief description of the team’s business 
plan, the two most outstanding technical features of the car, and the production costs of prototype and series. 



First Presentation Round 
During the first round, each team gets the opportunity to present to the judges. Therefore, the overall group 
of judges is divided into 10 small groups (of 3 judges each), who will together visit the team presentations. 
The judge groups will change during the day. At the end of each presentation, the judges are requested to ask 
questions. 

Part of presentation: Deep Dive Topic (DDT) 
After the submission of the executive summary, the teams will receive a specific deep dive topic from the pre - 
sentation judges prior the competition. Each team has to present this special deep dive topic in a detailed way 
as a part of the team’s business plan presentation to the judges. 

Schedule for each presentation: 
•  Maximum 10 minutes for set-up & preparation 
•  10 min for presentation 
•  5 min for questions 
•  5 min for De-briefing and scoring decision of the judges 
•  10 min for instant feedback to the teams 
•  5 min de-installation 
--> 45 minutes maximum for each presentation 
This time schedule needs to be followed strictly to not disrupt the overall time schedule for the whole day.
During the presentations, only judges and the presenting team participate. Guests may be allowed to attend at 
the discretion of any steering committee member or the team.
Finals
The best 3 to 5 teams will reach the presentation finals. These finals will be held in the evening in the marqu ee  
above the pits. The teams will present to the complete group of judges and to all others interested (i.e. other 
team etc.).
The 3 to 5 teams will present directly one after the other without any questions/interruptions by the judges. 
Afterwards, the judges will hold a short de-briefing and decide on a ranking.
The scores of the finalists are: 
  Top 1: 75   
  Top 2: 74   
  Top 3: 73   
  Top 4: 72   
  Top 5: 71  
If a team does not attend the finals despite its nomination, it will automatically receive 71 points. If a team 
misses their allocated period, the team will receive zero presentation points. The team that makes the best 
business presentation (regardless of the quality of the car) wins the event. 


6  PROTESTING OF RESULTS

(A) Required Review - Any team that intends to protest a rule, score, judge’ s  
decision or any other aspect of the competition, must present the issue to the 
FSG rules organizers, represented by Frank Röske for discussion, and possible 
resolution before the protest is filed. If you cannot locate Frank Röske, contact 
event control.
(B) Cause for Protest - A team may protest any rule interpretation, score or 
official action (unless specifically excluded from protest) which they feel has 
caused some actual, non-trivial, harm to their team, or has had a substantive 
effect on their score. Teams may not protest rule interpretations or actions 
that have not caused them any substantive damage.
(C) Protest Period - Protests must be filed within one hour after the action 
being protested has occurred or the scores for the activity involving the protest subject are posted.
(D) Protest Format - Protests must be handed in in a written form and submitted by the team captain to Hen- 
ning Nissen. If you cannot locate Henning Nissen, contact event control.
(E) Protest Bond - The protesting team must post a 25 points bond to be deducted from their score if the 
protest is denied.
(F) Decision - The decision of the officials regarding any protest is final. 

5  RESULTS

The results will be posted on the results board in the FSG Forum as soon as 
they are available. Furthermore, they will be published online at the FSG websi- 
te.
Endurance Scores are posted in 2 steps. Before publishing the times, the 
penalties are posted, because those are finished before the data of the 2 
timing systems are cross checked. In the second step, the endurance times 
are published.
The time slot for the protests is printed on the results page. Please note that 
the protest time for the overall results could be on Monday morning from 
9:00 – 10:00.
Please visit the results board at the FSG Forum regularly and listen to the announcements.
